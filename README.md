## Manuscript for Geophysics paper

Directory contains the LaTeX source of the manuscript as well as the notebooks
to reproduce all the figures.


## History

1. First submitted 22/01/2018 to Geophysics for the Software & Algorithms
   Section. The stable release at the time of submission of `empymod` was
   [Version 1.5.0](https://github.com/empymod/empymod/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
   and of `empyscripts` was
   [Version 0.2.0](https://github.com/empymod/empyscripts/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

2. Re-submitted 22/02/2018. The stable release at the time of submission of
   `empymod` was
   [Version 1.5.0](https://github.com/empymod/empymod/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
   and of `empyscripts` was
   [Version 0.3.0](https://github.com/empymod/empyscripts/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
   There is no difference in the article between the first and the second
   submission. In the first submission only the file `fdesign.py` was submitted
   as source code to Geophysics. The second submission contains a zip-file with
   the current version of `empymod` and `empyscripts` as well as all the
   notebooks to reproduce the figures.


## Instructions to reproduce the figures with the zip-file provided by the SEG

The piece of code related to the publication is `fdesign.py`, located in the
folder `notebooks/empyscripts` in the zip-file or in the folder `empyscripts`
on https://github.com/empymod/empyscripts.

- The zip-file provided by the SEG contains all files required to reproduce the
  figures of the article.
- Have a look at https://empymod.github.io for the latest version of `empymod`
  and `empyscripts`, further instructions, the manual, and many more examples
  and information.
- For a maintained version of the figures in the article see
  https://github.com/empymod/article-fdesign.


## Requirements

Required are Python version 3.4 or higher and the modules `NumPy` and `SciPy`
to use `fdesign`. To reproduce the figures with the provided notebooks the
modules `IPython`, `Jupyter`, and `matplotlib` are required additionally.

If you are new to Python I recommend using a Python distribution, which will
ensure that all dependencies are met, specifically properly compiled versions
of `NumPy` and `SciPy`; I recommend using Anaconda, https://www.anaconda.com.

The required modules `empymod` and `empyscripts` are included in the provided
source code (folder in which this README resides). Have a look at
https://empymod.github.io if you want to install the latest version of them.


## Reproducing

Start `Jupyter` and navigate to the notebooks-folder. The notebooks to
reproduce the figures in the article are:

1. **Figure-InversionCriterium**: Figure 1.
2. **Figure-ExampleDesign.ipynb**: Figures 2 and 3.
3. **Figure-KongKey.ipynb**: Figures 4 and 5.
4. **Figure-Errors.ipynb**: Figures 6 and 7.
5. **GPR-create-data.ipynb**: Creation of data for Figures 8-10 (see comments
   below).
6. **GPR-Figure.ipynb**: Figure 8.
7. **GPR-f-t.ipynb**: Figures 9 and 10.

Some comments regarding `GPR-create-data.ipynb`:
- If you want to reproduce the data for `EMmod` too, you will have to install
  `EMmod` as well (see http://software.seg.org/2015/0001).
- If you want to run the whole file, including the cell for `EMmod`, the whole
  script will take likely a day to run.
- The required data-zips are provided in the `notebooks/data`-directory on
  https://github.com/empymod/article-fdesign, so you can get them there instead
  of running `GPR-create-data.ipynb` in order to run `GPR-Figure.ipynb` and
  `GPR-f-t.ipynb`.

More notebooks (and maintained versions of the above ones) can be found on
https://github.com/empymod/article-fdesign.

**Note**: Some notebooks use LaTeX for axis labels. If you don't have LaTeX
installed, just comment out in the first cell the following line

    plt.rcParams['text.usetex'] = True
